## Project Description
This is a **Machine Learning application** built using the **XGBoost algorithm** to identify students at higher risk of dropping out. The goal is to enable early interventions by administrators to provide support to at-risk students, helping them achieve academic success while improving the institutionâ€™s graduation rates.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **AWS SageMaker Notebook** â€“ for training and experimentation  
- **Streamlit** â€“ for interactive web application deployment  
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ for data manipulation  
- **Plotly & Seaborn** â€“ for data visualization and feature selection  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ additional plotting support  
- **Optuna** â€“ for hyperparameter optimization  
- **Boto3 & AWS SDKs** â€“ for interacting with SageMaker endpoints  
- **Python-dotenv** â€“ for managing environment variables  

---

## Data & Features
- Original dataset: 34 features describing student demographics, academic performance, and socio-economic indicators.  
- Feature selection reduced the number of inputs to **11 key features** for efficient prediction.  
- Visualizations provide insight into relationships between features and dropout risk.

---

## Process

### 1. Data Visualization
- Used **Seaborn** and **Plotly** for exploratory analysis.  
- Avoided PCA to maintain interpretability in the front-end app.  
- Reduced features from 34 â†’ 11 based on importance and correlation.

### 2. Model Training
- Trained both **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models using AWS SageMaker.  
- **XGBoost** outperformed Random Forest, achieving better recall for the dropout class.  

**Training notebooks and scripts are available here:**

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization
- Used **Optuna** to optimize multiple parameters simultaneously.  
- Optimized for **recall** of the dropout class and overall **accuracy**.  
- Metrics achieved:
  - **Accuracy:** 88%  
  - **Recall (Dropout class):** 79%  

> Recall was prioritized to avoid false negatives â€” i.e., students at risk labeled as likely graduates.

### 4. Model Saving
- Model saved in **JSON format** to reduce memory usage and improve deployment efficiency.  

### 5. Deployment
- Deployed using **SageMaker serverless inference**.  
- Model artifacts stored in **AWS S3**.  
- Streamlit app consumes the endpoint for real-time predictions.

## Streamlit App
- Interactive web application for administrators to input student features and get predicted risk scores.  
- Includes additional **visualizations** to contextualize the prediction.  
- Sidebar navigation allows switching between **Prediction** and **Data Visualizations** pages.  

### Features:
- Input matching model-trained features  
- Predictions with confidence scores  
- Dynamic charts showing feature importance and correlations
